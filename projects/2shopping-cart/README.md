This project simulates a simple **shopping cart system** where the user can buy items from a small store. The store’s inventory is stored in a **map** with items as keys and their prices as values, while the user’s chosen items are stored in a **slice**. The program first asks how many items the user wants to buy and then reads each item name from the console, checking availability in the store. If the item exists, it’s added to the cart; otherwise, the user is informed that the item is unavailable. Once the cart is ready, the program calculates the total price using a **variadic function** and then applies a **dynamic discount** generated by a closure. Discounts are validated using a function that returns both the discounted total and a potential error. Finally, the user selects a payment method, and the program uses a **switch statement** to confirm the payment. Throughout, the program demonstrates Go concepts like data types, collections (slices and maps), control structures (`for`, `if`, `switch`), multiple return values, variadic functions, closures, and error handling in a practical real-world context.
