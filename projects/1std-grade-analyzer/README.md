This project is a **student grading system** that collects student names and their subject scores from the console, stores the data in slices and maps, and then processes it using helper functions. For each student, it calculates the **average, minimum, and maximum scores**, and assigns a **grade (A–D)** based on the average using a `switch` statement. The results, including scores and grades, are displayed in a structured format. Additionally, the program demonstrates **safe division with error handling** through a dedicated function that prevents division by zero. Overall, the program showcases Go’s core concepts—data types, collections, control structures, multiple return values, and error handling—in a practical context of managing and evaluating student performance.
