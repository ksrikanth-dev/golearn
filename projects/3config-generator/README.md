This project simulates a simple **network device management system** that collects information about multiple devices, analyzes them, and generates dummy configurations. The user first enters the number of devices, then provides each device’s name, IP address, and whether it is active. The program validates IP addresses, stores device details in collections (slices and maps), and generates a dummy configuration for each device with common networking commands (like setting hostname, assigning IP, enabling SSH, etc.). Inactive devices get an additional `"shutdown"` line in their configuration. After data entry, the program summarizes each device’s details, calculates how many are active, identifies the device with the longest name, demonstrates safe status lookups, and finally prints the auto-generated configurations for all devices. It showcases Go concepts like data types, maps, slices, loops, conditionals, functions, and error handling in a practical networking context.
