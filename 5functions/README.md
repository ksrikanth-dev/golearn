# Functions

## Overview

This session is designed to provide a deep understanding of functions in Go. It covers everything from basic syntax and concepts to advanced topics like variadic functions, closures, recursion, function types, anonymous functions, defer/panic/recover, and best practices. Each section includes reasoning about why the concept exists, where it is useful, and example use cases.

Functions in Go are **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be treated like any other value — assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This allows Go to support a variety of programming styles: procedural, functional, and modular.

## **Introduction to Functions in Go**

### Objectives:

* Understand the purpose of functions: Functions allow code reuse, organization, and modularity.
* Learn function syntax and usage in Go: Understand how to define and call functions with parameters and return types.

### Topics Covered:

* **What is a function?**
  A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Instead of writing the same logic multiple times, you encapsulate it into a function. This promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and allows for better testing and maintenance.

* **Function declaration syntax**
  In Go, functions are declared using the `func` keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and return types. This makes the function's behavior explicit and readable.

* **Function naming conventions**
  Naming conventions follow visibility rules: `camelCase` for internal use, `PascalCase` for exported (public) use. This helps organize packages and promotes encapsulation.

* **Return values**
  Go supports multiple return values, which simplifies error handling and eliminates the need for complex structs or wrappers.

### Example:

```go
// function definition
func greet(name string) string {
	return "Hello, " + name
}

func main() {
	// function call
	fmt.Println(greet("Alex"))
}
```

### Activity:

* Write a function that returns the square of a number.
* Write a function that checks if a number is even.

**Where it’s useful:**

* Building libraries with reusable code.
* Performing repeated computations/operations (e.g., mathematical/business logic related operations).
* Organizing large projects into smaller logical pieces (microservices, package-level APIs).

---

## **Multiple Return Values**

### Objectives:

* Learn how to return multiple values from a function: Useful for returning a result along with error or status info.

### Topics Covered:

* **Multiple return values**
  Functions can return multiple values like `(int, error)`. This simplifies error checking and reduces the need for exceptions.

* **Ignoring values with `_`**
  Helps skip unneeded values and prevents compiler errors for unused variables.

* **Error returns pattern**
  Idiomatic Go handles errors explicitly, returning them as values instead of throwing exceptions.

### Example:

```go
func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, fmt.Errorf("cannot divide by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}

func main() {
    result, err := divide(10, 2)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Println("Result:", result)
    }
}
```

### Activity:

* Write a function to find the min and max value in a slice.

**Why it exists:**

* To make error handling explicit.
* To simplify working with optional or fallback values (e.g., return `value, ok` pattern).

**Where useful:**

* Numerous use cases: File reading (e.g., returning `data` and `error`), opening a DB connection, making an API call etc.
* Parsing functions: `strconv.Atoi("123") (int, error)` returns both result and error.
* Lookups in maps: `val, ok := myMap[key]` → avoids panics.

---

## **Named Return Values and Naked Returns**

### Objectives:

* Understand named return values: These help document return values.
* Use naked returns appropriately: They return the named return variables implicitly.

### Topics Covered:

* **Named return variables**
  Useful for documentation and readability when the function has multiple exit points.

* **Naked return syntax**
  Allows returning without explicitly listing variables, but can reduce clarity in longer functions.

* **Pros and cons of naked return**
  Pros: concise. Cons: may obscure logic.

### Example:

```go
func addAndMultiply(x, y int) (sum, product int) {
    sum = x + y
    product = x * y
    return // naked return
}
```

### Activity:

* Modify earlier functions to use named returns.

**Where useful:**

* In short utility functions or wrappers with clearly named output.
* Wrappers around standard library where behavior is simple.

**Where not useful:**

* In large functions where implicit returns make the logic harder to follow.

---

## **Variadic Functions**

### Objectives:

* Learn to work with functions that accept a variable number of arguments: Useful when number of inputs is dynamic.

### Topics Covered:

* **Variadic parameters**
  Using `...` allows passing any number of arguments, especially useful in math, logging, or utility libraries.

* **Working with slices in variadic functions**
  Internally, variadic arguments are treated as slices, enabling standard operations.

* **Passing slices to variadic functions**
  Use `slice...` syntax to unpack slices.

### Example:

```go
func sum(nums ...int) int {
    total := 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        total += num
    }
    return total
}
```

### Activity:

* Write a function that finds the average of numbers using variadic parameters.

**Why it exists:**

* To allow flexibility in API design without overloading functions.

**Where useful:**

* Many use cases: library functions (e.g. slice `append()`), Logging functions (e.g., `fmt.Println`) etc.
* Math utilities, e.g., `min(a ...int)` to avoid writing separate overloads.

## **Functions as Values and Function Types**

### Objectives:

* Understand that functions are first-class citizens in Go: They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from functions.

### Topics Covered:

* **Assigning functions to variables**
  Enables dynamic behavior and decouples logic.

* **Passing functions as arguments**
  Used in filtering, sorting, validation logic.

* **Returning functions from functions**
  Enables factory functions and dynamic behavior.

* **Defining custom function types**
  Improves readability and type safety when dealing with higher-order functions.

### Example:

```go
type operation func(int, int) int

func add(a, b int) int { return a + b }
func execute(op operation, a, b int) int {
    return op(a, b)
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("result: ", execute(add, 10, 5))
}
```

### Activity:

* Create a calculator that uses function types for different operations.

**Where useful:**

* Middleware chaining in web servers (e.g., HTTP handlers).
* Strategy pattern implementation : The Strategy Pattern is a design pattern used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
  **Example:** Payment processing → PayPal, Stripe, COD — same interface, different implementations.

---

## **Anonymous Functions and Closures**

### Objectives:

* Learn to write anonymous functions: Functions without a name.
* Understand closures and their scope: Closures capture and use variables from their surrounding scope.

### Topics Covered:

* **Anonymous function syntax**
  Quick function declarations, often used in short logic or goroutines.

* **Assigning to variables**
  Useful for callbacks and internal utilities.

* **Immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE)**
  Useful for scoping or initializing.

* **Closures capturing variables**
  Maintains state without using global variables.

### Example:

```go
func incrementer() func() int {
    count := 0
    return func() int { // closure
        count++
        return count
    }
}
```

### Activity:

* Create a closure that generates even numbers.

**Where useful:**

* Stateful counters.
* Callback handlers.
* Encapsulated logic in goroutines.
* Caching expensive computations inside closures.

---

## **Recursion in Go**

### Objectives:

* Understand how recursion works: A function calls itself until it reaches a base case.

### Topics Covered:

* **Base case and recursive case**
  Required to prevent infinite loops.

* **Stack and performance considerations**
  Recursive depth can be limited; iteration may be more efficient.

* **Recursion vs Iteration**
  Recursion is elegant for problems like trees, graphs, and divide-and-conquer.

### Example:

```go
func factorial(n int) int {
    if n == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return n * factorial(n-1)
}
```

### Activity:

* Write a recursive function to calculate Fibonacci numbers.
* Write a recursive function to traverse a nested data structure.

**Where useful:**

* Tree traversal.
* Combinatorial problems (e.g., permutations).
* Parsing nested structures (e.g., JSON, XML).

---

## **Higher-Order Functions and Functional Patterns**

### Objectives:

* Use functions that operate on or return other functions: Supports modular, reusable, and abstract logic.

### Topics Covered:

* **Filtering slices using predicate functions**
  Enables clean and flexible logic separation.

* **Composing functions**
  Breaks down logic into reusable pieces.

* **Using closures for state**
  Replaces global state, improves testability.

### Example:

```go
func filter(slice []int, predicate func(int) bool) []int {
    result := []int{}
    for _, v := range slice {
        if predicate(v) {
            result = append(result, v)
        }
    }
    return result
}
```

### Activity:

* Filter even numbers from a slice using a higher-order function.
* Create a pipeline of transformation functions.

**Where useful:**

* Data processing pipelines.
* Middleware composition.
* Event-driven systems (e.g., listeners, hooks).

---

## **Real-world Use Cases and Best Practices**

### Objectives:

* Solidify understanding through real-world examples and practices.

### Topics Covered:

* **Structuring functions in packages**
  Improves organization and discoverability.

* **Testable function design**
  Pure functions are easier to test.

* **Avoiding side effects**
  Predictable functions lead to fewer bugs.

* **Function documentation**
  Promotes maintainability and onboarding.

* **Idiomatic Go practices**
  Aligns with community conventions, improving readability and collaboration.

### Activities:

* Create a utility package with multiple functions.
* Refactor a monolithic function into small reusable units.

### Wrap-up:

* Review key concepts
* Cheat sheet

```go
// Basic function
func greet(name string) string {
    return "Hello, " + name
}

// Multiple returns
